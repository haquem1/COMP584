# SWISH
Restaurant Comparison Using Yelp API
----
This is the tutorial that I followed to integrate Angular2 and Webpack into SWISH.
https://angular.io/guide/webpack

This branch integrates NG2 into the project.
Here is how you get it to run.

bring up a terminal and cd into the project.
1. Start the server
npm run dev

Bring up another terminal and cd into the project
2. Start webpack so that it compiles NG2 to public and watch any changes
npm run buildng2

Now, the project should be up and running in localhost:8080.

TODO: Gotta clean up that package.json file.
I just threw everything that angular2 needed, but I kept some of the testing packages.
